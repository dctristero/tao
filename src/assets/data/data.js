    like the drawing of a bow.
    The top is bent downward;
    the bottom is bent up.
    The excess is taken from,
    and the deficient is given to.
    
    The Tao works to use the excess,
    and gives to that which is depleted.
    The way of people is to take from the depleted,
    and give to those who already have an excess.
    
    Who is able to give to the needy from their excess?
    Only someone who is following the way of the Tao.
    
    This is why the Master gives
    expecting nothing in return.
    She does not dwell on her past accomplishments,
    and does not glory in any praise.`

    Yet nothing is better than water,
    for overcoming the hard and rigid,
    because nothing can compete with it.
    
    Everyone knows that the soft and yielding
    overcomes the rigid and hard,
    but few can put this knowledge into practice.
    
    Therefore the Master says:
    "Only he who is the lowest servant of the kingdom,
    is worthy to become its ruler.
    He who is willing to tackle the most unpleasant tasks,
    is the best ruler in the world."

    does what she knows is right,
    and makes no demands of others.
    A virtuous person will do the right thing,
    and persons with no virtue will take advantage of others.
    
    The Tao does not choose sides,
    the good person receives from the Tao
    because she is on its side.`

    Give them all of the things they want,
    and they will see that they do not need them.
    Teach them that death is a serious thing,
    and to be content to never leave their homes.
    Even though they have plenty
    of horses, wagons and boats,
    they won't feel that they need to use them.
    Even if they have weapons and shields,
    they will keep them out of sight.
    Let people enjoy the simple technologies,
    let them enjoy their food,
    let them make their own clothes,
    let them be content with their own homes,
    and delight in the customs that they cherish.
    Although the next country is close enough
    that they can hear their roosters crowing and dogs barking,
    they are content never to visit each other
    all of the days of their life.`

    The Master desires no possessions.
    Since the things she does is for the people,
    she has more than she needs.

    the more she has for herself.

    The Tao of the Wise person acts by not competing.`
